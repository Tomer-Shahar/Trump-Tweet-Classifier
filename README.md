# Trump Tweet Classifier
Classifying if a tweet was written by Donald Trump or not through machine learning.

Using several popular ML algorithms and a few thousand tweets to learn from, I created several models that can classify if a tweet was written by Donald Trump or not. This was an assignment as part of a course in NLP. The features were extracted using methods from NLP and the models themselves were based on common ML algorithms such as Random Forest or SVC.
